                <h3>Lord Byron was on to something when he waxed lyrical about
                    the Greek islands. But with more than 5.000 to choose from,
                    of which only 227 are inhabited, which ones are the very
                    best Greek islands? Here we reveal the ones to get in a
                    speedboat for!</h3>

                <p> Spreading in two main seas, the Aegean and the Ionian Sea,
                    the Greek islands are divided into smaller groups.
                    This section will give you information for 21 islands in
                    Greece. The most popular island group in Greece is certainly
                    the Cyclades islands: <a class="islands" href="#I11"><b>Santorini</b></a> island,
                    <a class="islands" href="#I6"><b>Serifos</b></a>, <a class="islands" href="#I18"><b>Andros</b></a>,
                    <a class="islands" href="#I9"><b>Mykonos</b></a> island, <a class="islands" href="#I1"><b>Amorgos</b></a>,
                    <a class="islands" href="#I16"><b>Naxos</b></a>, <a class="islands" href="#I17"><b>Tinos</b></a>,
                    <a class="islands" href="#I3"><b>Folegandros</b></a>, <a class="islands" href="#I2"><b>Milos</b></a>,
                    <a class="islands" href="#I4"><b>Syros</b></a> and <a class="islands" href="#I19"><b>Sifnos</b></a> are
                    famous islands all over the world, while the rest of
                    Cyclades keep lower profile in tourism development. The
                    Cycladic architecture is world famous and the culture of the
                    population is very rich. The islands of Dodecanese and
                    Ionian are also very popular. Travel to
                    <a class="islands" href="#I20"><b>Astypalea</b></a>, <a class="islands" href="#I8"><b>Corfu</b></a>
                    island, <a class="islands" href="#I14"><b>Rhodes</b></a> island,
                    <a class="islands" href="#I12"><b>Zakynthos/Zante</b></a>, Kos and
                    <a class="islands" href="#I10"><b>Kefalonia</b></a> also get very popular, while
                    <a class="islands" href="#I5"><b>Ithaca</b></a>, <a class="islands" href="#I15"><b>Symi</b></a>,
                    <a class="islands" href="#I21"><b>Patmos</b></a> and Skiathos are islands that are
                    becoming more and more famous every year. Make sure you
                    will not miss the opportunity to visit the infamous
                    <a class="islands" href="#I13"><b>Crete</b></a> island or the Saronic Gulf's great
                    little gems like <a class="islands" href="#I7"><b>Hydra</b></a> either! The good
                    thing is that despite tourist development, the Greek islands
                    do not lose their original character and provide wonderful
                    atmosphere for true relaxation. Have in mind that many
                    times, an island and its main village has the same name.
                    Also in Cyclades islands, most capital towns are called Chora.

                <h5><b>The best Greek Island for: Deep-blue seas and wide-open spaces</b></h5>

                <p> It’s not easy to get to Amorgos. In high winds, the fast
                    ferries stay grounded and the slow boat takes upwards of
                    eight hours from Athens. When you disembark at Katapola,
                    a sleepy harbour lined with great little fish tavernas
                    (our favourites are Prekas and To Mouragio), a sign
                    announces: 'Welcome to Amorgos. Nobody will find you here.'
                </p>

                <div id="text">
                    <p> That’s just the point. This craggy Cycladic island has
                        always attracted loners, hikers, divers and pilgrims, who
                        shuffle up the cliff face to the Monastery of Hozoviotissa,
                        a sliver of white dangling 300 metres above the sea.
                        The water here is a million shades of blue and so
                        startlingly clear you can see every sea urchin lurking on
                        the rocky shore. Even the sage-scented hiking trails are
                        called Blue Paths, because the sea and sky are visible in
                        all directions.
                    </p>

                    <p> With a population of under 2,000, the locals are outnumbered
                        by shaggy goats that blend in perfectly with the burnished
                        landscape and hippie vibe. But you don't have to be a
                        recluse to fall for Amorgos. There are plenty of all-day,
                        late-night bars where Amorgos groupies meet, summer after
                        summer: Jazzmin, in Chora, for backgammon and cocktails;
                        Pergalidi in Langada for herbal infusions and jazzy tunes;
                        Seladi in Tholaria, with giddying views and a telescope for

                <h5><b>The best Greek Island for: A photogenic and dramatic coastline</b></h5>

                <p> Everyone knows the Venus de Milo (which has stood in the
                    Louvre since the 19th century). Until recently, very few had
                    heard of Milos, the volcanic island where Aphrodite’s
                    graceful likeness was discovered. Those in the know
                    jealously guard their treasured island, and especially its
                    70 (or more) beaches — surely the most diverse and dramatic
                    coastline of all the Greek Islands.

                    <p> Little by little, though, Milos is being
                        discovered. Instagram is saturated with no-filter shots
                        of the undulating cliffs at Sarakiniko, the bottle-green
                        swimming hole at Papafragas, and colourful, rickety
                        syrmata, tiny boat houses wedged between rock and sea.
                        (You’ll find the best photo opportunities at Klima and
                        Mandrakia). This painterly landscape was shaped by the
                        minerals that have long been a source of wealth –
                        obsidian, alum, barite and sulphur, which still bubbles
                        up in the island’s many hot springs. As the
                        11,000-year-old mining industry is gradually giving way
                        to tourism, several chic hotels have made an appearance.
                        Go now, before the trickle of visitors turns into
                        a tide.
                    </p>

                    <p> Milos's colours and wealth and the shaping of its history
                        derive from its having been flung out of the sea by
                        volcanoes that blew around two million years ago, the
                        principal crater forming one of the largest harbours in
                        the Aegean at Adamas ('diamond' in Greek).

                <h5><b>The best Greek Island for: Authenticity with a bohemian buzz</b></h5>

                <p> The village square should be your first port of call on any
                    Greek island: settle into your favourite café, pick up local
                    gossip, and adjust to the languid pace of life. On
                    Folegandros, this presents a challenge: the cliff-hanger
                    capital, Chora, has not one but three squares, each brimming
                    with a jumble of cafés, tavernas and dinky raki bars. We
                    recommend Pounta (pounta.gr), where the Danish owner makes
                    (and sells) the lopsided cups and bowls in which your coffee
                    and Greek yogurt are served. From Chora, zigzagging steps
                    lead up, up and away to the only real landmark, Panagia
                    church; make the pilgrimage at sunrise (perhaps after an
                    all-nighter at dimunitive Astarti bar).

                    <p> Folegandros – which means ‘iron hard’ in ancient Greek –
                        is as barren as its name suggests. Fruit trees are
                        protected from fierce winds by rings of stones. You
                        won’t find sandy beaches lined with sunbeds; only
                        limpid, pebbly coves, such as Katergo, Ambeli and
                        Livadaki. Water taxis service some beaches in high
                        season; otherwise you’ll have to scramble down rocky
                        footpaths to cool off. On your way home, stop at
                        Synantisi in Ano Meria for the island speciality of
                        matsata (goat or rabbit stew with hand-made pasta). 
                    </p>

                    <p> Folegandros, named after the son of King Minos, was once
                        thought of as so isolated that political prisoners were
                        exiled there until the last century. However its beauty
                        and charm are such that many of those sent there chose
                        to settle permanently.

                <p> On Syros, capital of the Cyclades, you won’t find sugar-cube
                    villages and whitewashed lanes. The colourful 19th-century
                    city of Ermoupoli is built on twin peaks – one Orthodox,
                    the other Catholic, the heritage of a long Venetian
                    occupation. There’s still a strong Italian flavour in
                    Ermoupoli’s marble piazzas, princely mansions, and miniature
                    replica of La Scala, the showpiece of a year-round cultural
                    scene. Syros hosts festivals of animation, dance, digital
                    art, film, classical music, jazz and rembetiko, the Greek
                    blues popularised by local musician Markos Vamvakaris.
                    A few rembetiko joints have survived in the upper town,
                    Ano Syra.

                    <p> Once Greece’s ship-building centre, Syros still has a
                        boatyard at Neorio. But the most splendid legacy of the
                        shipping industry are the manor houses in Vaporia and
                        Poseidonia. The beaches are slightly less splendid —
                        with the exception of Delfini, Varvarousa, and Aetos in
                        the wild north. But fabulous seaside tavernas abound:
                        Ambela (ambela.gr) for fresh fish; Iliovassilema
                        (chefbougiouris.gr) on Galissas beach for samphire and
                        sea-urchin salad and rockfish soup; Allou Yallou
                        (allouyialousyros.gr) for lobster with ouzo. 
                    </p>

                    <p> Perhaps the prettiest restaurant of all is Mazi
                        (mazi-syros.com), a vine-covered courtyard festooned
                        with bougainvillaea. Before you leave, stock up on
                        loukoumi (rose-tinted Turkish delight) and San Michalis
                        cheese from Prekas delicatessen (prekasyros.gr), and
                        visit Zylo (zyloeyewear.com) for hand-made wooden

                <p> Despite its legendary stature, the homeland of Homer's hero,
                    Odysseus, remains surprisingly under-the-radar. Ithaca’s
                    turquoise and emerald coves are popular with the sailing
                    set, but few visitors venture into the forested hills. So,
                    you might be the only person exploring dramatic hiking
                    trails, like the heady trek to the church of Anogi, covered
                    in 16th-century frescoes (ask for the key at the village
                    coffee shop), or the 8th-century BC ruins of Odysseus’
                    palace. Do stop at Yefuri (facebook.com/Yefuri) on the way
                    down, for thin pizza, fat chips, and its famous lemon tart.

                        for ice-cream sundaes, excellent cocktails, and a
                        soundtrack to make your heart sing. Ideal for low-key
                        family holidays or retreats, rugged little Ithaca is

                        separate islands linked by a narrow isthmus. Vathy is
                        the only significant settlement in the south, while the
                        mighty northern massif holds delightful villages such as
                        Stavros and Anogi, and is peppered with little coves
                        holding pocket-sized resorts such as Frikes and Kioni.

                    retreat of interior designers and architects who prefer to
                    keep the sandy beaches to themselves. (One French home-owner
                    is so protective of her hideaway that she tells all her
                    friends she summers on nearby Sifnos.) Even in August,
                    you’ll find coves where you can skinny dip in blissful
                    solitude. That’s because the best beaches (Kalo Ambeli,
                    Vagia, Skala) are only accessible via bone-rattling dirt
                    roads or donkey tracks. Better still, rent a motor boat
                    from the laidback harbour, Livada. Make sure to moor outside
                    Anna’s taverna on Sikamia beach for freshly caught fish and

                        are barely any beaches? You can always find a slab of
                        sun-baked rock from which to leap rock from which to

                        lanes, donkeys, rocks and sea. In addition to the
                        island’s exquisitely preserved stone architecture,
                        criss-crossing rural paths and clear, deep waters, you
                        can find a good cappuccino along the harbour, which is

                <p> Corfu is the It Girl of the Ionian islands. The cosmopolitan
                    capital is a charming clash of Venetian, British and French
                    colonial influences. Evenings kick off with cocktails on the
                    Liston (a colonnade modelled on Paris's rue de Rivoli),
                    followed by dinner at Corfu Sailing Club, overlooking a
                    floodlit fortress.

                    <p> With its pastel villages, rolling olive groves and
                        grand manor houses, the rest of the island recalls
                        Tuscany - but with far better beaches. The smart set
                        stay on Corfu's north-east coast (nicknamed
                        Kensington-on-Sea) where the Rothschilds like to unwind.
                        It's wall-to-wall Sloanes and speedboats at Agni, a
                        tiny fishing village with three rival tavernas (Toula's
                        is the best). From here, you can rent a boat and putter
                        to your own cove: perhaps Nissaki, Agios Stefanos or
                        Kerasia. These idyllic bays still resemble the
                        'delectable landscape' that Lawrence Durrell fell for
                        in the 1930s — now back in vogue thanks to the ITV
                        series, The Durrells. Or venture inland to Ambelonas,
                        an enchanting winery, restaurant and cooking school
                        that specialises in Corfiot dishes, such as squid with
                        chickpea and turmeric mousse and rose petal jelly.
                        Steer clear of the south, especially Kavos. Unless you
                        happen to like wet T-shirt contests.

                    <p> UNESCO has declared the island’s historic centre a
                        world heritage site. The stately buildings with
                        neoclassical influences will dazzle you. Who could not
                        be moved by the Palace of St Michael and St Georgiou,
                        the Liston Arcade, the Reading Society, the Catholic
                        cathedral, the Maitland rotunda, the Ionian Parliament 
                        and  the Kapodistrias family mansion. In the famous
                        alleyways of Campiello, with washing lines hanging
                        above you, and in the opulent hotels with their VIP
                        guests, you will feel like a star in a period movie.

                        as Mouse Island, just large enough to hold the
                        Pantokrator monastery, and right next to it, the famous

                        dedicated to the Virgin Mary,  connected to the

                    starting in the late 1950s - became a bohemian mecca and is
                    now one of the glitziest, most renowned tourist destinations
                    in the country. This central Cyclade was briefly the premier
                    Mediterranean resort for gay travellers, though since then
                    Mykonos has tried to reinvent itself for a more varied

                        south-coast beaches much before noon. There’s also no
                        shortage of clothing and jewellery boutiques in the main
                        town (Hóra) for a spot of retail therapy. It is,
                        however, strongly suggested that you vacate Hóra itself
                        between 10am and 5pm – when one cruise ship is in port,
                        let alone two or three, the streets essentially become
                        impassable.

                        sand covered with sunworshippers, Mykonos has a beach
                        to suit your needs. The island boasts 25 beaches, to be
                        precise, and they’re justifiably its biggest natural
                        attraction. Partygoers, look no further than Paradise
                        or Super Paradise, dominated by eponymous clubs; Paraga
                        and Psarou are other favourites for beach parties. Elia
                        is Mykonos’ longest sweep of white sand, popular with
                        families, while Platys Gialos and Kalafatis are
                        particularly good for water sports.

                    Crescent-shaped Santorini (or Thíra), the

                    <p> Did you know that the whole complex of Santorini
                        islands is still an active volcano (the same as Méthana,
                        Mílos and Nísiros) and probably the only volcano in the
                        world whose crater is in the sea? The islands that form
                        Santorini came into existence as a result of intensive
                        volcanic activity; twelve huge eruptions occurred, one
                        every 20,000 years approximately, and each violent
                        eruption caused the collapse of the volcano’s central
                        part creating a large crater (caldera). The volcano,
                        however, managed to recreate itself over and over again.

                        not many places in the world where you can enjoy
                        exquisitely clear waters while perched on the rim of a
                        massive active volcano in the middle of the sea! The

                        destination” for couples not only from Greece but from
                        all over the world. A trip to Santorini with the other

                        photo of the island’s famous Caldera and exchanging

                <div id="text">
                    <p> Crete’s natural beauty is equalled only by the richness
                        of its history. The island is the birthplace of the
                        first advanced society on European soil, the Minoans,
                        who ruled some 4000 years ago, and you’ll find evocative
                        vestiges all over, including the famous Palace of
                        Knossos. At the crossroads of three continents, Crete
                        has been coveted and occupied by consecutive invaders.
                        History imbues Hania and Rethymno, where labyrinthine
                        lanes – laid out by the Venetians – are lorded over by
                        mighty fortresses, and where gorgeously restored
                        Renaissance mansions rub rafters with mosques and
                        Turkish bathhouses. The Byzantine influence stands in
                        magnificent frescoed chapels, churches and monasteries.
                    </p>

                    <p> Crete’s spirited people champion their unique culture
                        and customs, and time-honoured traditions remain a
                        dynamic part of the island’s soul. Look for musicians
                        striking up a free-form jam on local instruments, like
                        the stringed lyra, or wedding celebrants weaving their
                        time-honoured traditional regional dances. Meeting
                        regular folk gossiping in kafeneia (coffee houses),
                        preparing their Easter feast, tending to their sheep
                        or celebrating during the island’s many festivals is
                        what makes a visit to Crete so special.

                <h4 id="I14">Rhodes</h4>
                <h5><b>The best Greek Island for: Travelling back in time</b></h5>

                <p> When the writer Lawrence Durrell arrived in Rhodes after
                    World War II, he found an island devastated by centuries
                    of crusaders and invaders. Like the fallen Colossus, it was
                    'a Rhodes dispersed into a million fragments, waiting to be
                    built up again.' Since then, Rhodes has reinvented itself
                    as one of Greece's top travel destinations. The big draw is
                    the medieval citadel in Rhodes Town: stroll along the
                    battlements and you'll spy Byzantine churches, Roman ruins,
                    synagogues and minarets.

                    <p> The mediaeval Old Town, the port of Mandraki, the
                        Acropolis of Lindos, the ancient cities of Kamiros and
                        Ialysos, the Valley of the Butterflies. A landscape
                        with eye-catching, generous natural beauty, a rich
                        history and endless attractions make Rhodes one of the
                        most popular holiday destinations in Greece. Vast sandy
                        beaches, emerald waters, castles and ancient
                        civilisations, gourmet restaurants and traditional
                        tavernas serving local delicacies. 
                    </p>

                    <p> Although no traces of the statue remain, it is  said
                        that the Colossus of Rhodes (one of the Seven Wonders
                        of the Ancient World) once stood in place of the
                        statues of deer now at the harbour. According to the
                        stories,  ships sailed beneath its giant legs  and
                        every night the passage was closed with an enormous
                        chain.
                    </p>

                    <p>It has been said that Rhodes was the first island in the
                        Aegean to cultivate a vineyard and make wine. It’s no
                        coincidence that in ancient times Rhodians were
                        considered the largest wine merchants in the
                        Mediterranean. Today’s wines are excellent too.

                        whole town is now a national monument. You need strong
                        legs to explore - it's about 500 steps up to the
                        crumbling acropolis - but you won't need a car.
                        The only proper road peters out at Panormitis monastery,
                        a major pilgrimage site. Ravishing beaches such as
                        Ayios Yorgos Disalonas (backed by monumental cliffs)
                        and Marathounda (where goats will try to filch your
                        picnic) are only accessible by boat or on foot. In the
                        rugged hinterland, more than 100 monasteries are hidden
                        among the pine and cypress forests.

                <p> Naxos is the biggest and the greenest island in the
                    Cyclades. It has high mountains, fertile valleys, lush
                    green gorges, stunning seascapes and traditional villages
                    perched high on mountain tops, where the inhabitants still
                    wear their traditional dress and live off the fruits of the
                    land. Naxos is also home to beautiful old churches,
                    monasteries and Venetian castles coexisting harmoniously
                    with the Cycladic architecture.

                    <p> Naxiots once made considerable fortunes exporting potatoes,
                        cheese, marble and emery. Locals bequeathed undesirable
                        seaside plots - useless for farming - to their laziest
                        offspring. When tourists cottoned on to the island's scores
                        of fabulous beaches, these wastrels found themselves
                        sitting on gold mines. The west coast of Naxos is fringed
                        with mile upon mile of powdery sands. Agios Prokopios and
                        Agia Anna delight toddlers and teenagers alike with their
                        shallow waters and beach bars. As you head south, the
                        beaches get wilder: Plaka, where you can gallop across the
                        dunes on horseback, Mikri Vigla for windsurfing and
                        kite-surfing, and crystal-clear Kastraki.

                        super-sized kouros statues are hidden in the hills and
                        there are dozens of drowsy villages to explore. Try
                        kitron, the local citron liqueur, at the Vallindras
                        distillery in Halki or sample homemade wine and arseniko
                        cheese under the plane trees in Ano Potamia village.
                        No wonder Herodotus described Naxos as 'the happiest

                        the Temple of Poseidon, where pilgrims are purified

                        believers descend upon Tinos, to accompany the
                        procession of the miraculous icon. You can hardly make

                        church, overlooking Tinos town since 1880. Be a witness

                        For all its wealth, it is laid-back and discreet,
                        shy of mass tourism, awaiting discovery by the

                        their earnings a century or more ago. The broad main

                <div id="text">
                    <p> Among the Cycladic islands, Sifnos stands out for both
                        its architecture and natural beauty. Once a thriving
                        gold and silver mining location, it has, since ancient
                        times, cultivated a reputation for the finer things in
                        life. Today the island combines the picturesque with a
                        rich tradition in cuisine and crafts, along with a
                        high-level infrastructure in tourism. Despite its
                        refined culture and “Cycladic chic” ambience, Sifnos
                        retains a low profile that instills peacefulness in
                        the visitor. 
                    </p>

                    <p> Sifnos by night is a one-way road. Whatever you end up
                        doing, you will pass through the famous street of
                        Apollonia, teeming with restaurants, cafes, chapels,
                        boutiques and stone dwellings with beautiful patios;
                        an ideal setting, in fact, for sipping cocktails!
                        The island’s soil is famously fortified by clay, water
                        and sun. Potters set up their workshops here centuries
                        ago and their ceramics became famous throughout Greece.
                        Visit the workshops, where traditional artisans still
                        use the potter’s wheel, and Apollonia’s Folklore Museum
                        to find out all about this unique art.

                    <p> It’s been dubbed “The Butterfly of the Aegean,” partly
                        because of its peculiar shape and partly because of the
                        beauty of the landscape. For those willing to travel
                        off the beaten track, it’s love at first sight. At the
                        southeastern edge of the Aegean, in the Dodecanese
                        (not the Cyclades as some may think), there is an
                        island rich in imagery and emotions. Many stay forever
                        devoted to this island of white light, with its
                        crystal-clear water, sun-drenched beaches, historical
                        heritage and hospitable residents.
                    </p>

                    <p> Astypalaia’s beaches may not have a cosmopolitan vibe,
                        but they offer something else: translucent water,
                        relaxation and tranquility. The most beautiful beach on
                        the island is Kaminakia, but Vatses, Livadi, Steno and
                        Psili Ammos are also lovely.
                    </p>

                    <p>Give yourself an adrenaline rush. There’s a climbing
                        site at Ftera, just 20 minutes outside the island’s
                        hora. The relief of the limestone rocks has created
                        two climbing sites, offering some 20 routes of varying
                        difficulty. Are you up for it?

                <h5><b>The best Greek Island for: Stark mystique and show-stopping villas</b></h5>

                <p> Worldwide known as a sacred island for it is the place
                    where Saint John wrote the Book of Revelation, Patmos is an
                    ideal destination for nature lovers thanks to its lace-like
                    coastline, sheer cliffs and volcanic soil. Designated as
                    “Holy Island” by the Greek Parliament in 1981 as well as a
                    World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1999, Patmos had been used
                    as a place of exile by the Romans on account of its steep
                    morphology. That’s how St. John found safe refuge here in
                    the 1st century A.D., exiled by the Emperor Domitian.

                <div id="text">
                    <p> Patmos has an indefinable je ne sais quoi - an otherworldly
                        quality that radiates from its crowning glory, the medieval
                        monastery of St John. This turreted fortress, bursting with
                        Byzantine relics, is named after John the Divine, who
                        conjured up his apocalyptic revelations in a cave nearby.
                        Pure-white Chora, a World Heritage Site, is where A-listers
                        and fashion editors stay. High walls and heavy doors
                        conceal magnificent mansions dating back to the 16th century.
                    </p>

                    <p> The almighty church has kept nightlife in check. If you
                        must see and be seen, head to quietly glamorous Astivi
                        or Stoa bar, on miniature Agia Lesvias square, in Hora.
                        Beach life is generally languid and low-key; Psili Ammos
                        and Livadi Geranou are our favourite hideouts. Dinner
                        reservations are essential at Benetos, for Med-Asian
                        fusion on an organic farm, and Lambi for grilled fish
                        on a purple pebble beach.
                    </p>

                    <p> Joining the Patmos in-crowd requires commitment. There's
                        no airport and it's a nine-hour ferry journey from
                        Athens, which keeps the hoi polloi at bay. Seriously
                        reclusive types hop on a fishing boat from Patmos to
                        Marathi (population: 12) and play castaway at Pantelis,
                        a divine taverna with modest rooms to let.
